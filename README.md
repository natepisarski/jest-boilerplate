# jest-boilerplate
This repository sets up an NPM project with Jest and Yarn. It's also configured to allow you to use ES modules with Jest
out-of-the-box. Normally, you cannot use ES modules with Jest at all (it's interpreted as a syntax error).

This repository exists to be a starting point for other unit-test-enabled NPM packages. All you need to do to customize
the project is edit the fields in the package.json.

# License
Since this is a "boilerplate" project, there is no license in particular (as it would affect your derivative works).

So, you may consider this repository as legally available for use in your project. If you clone this repository and license
your project with MIT, the GPL, BSD-3-clause, or basically anything, it's valid. No legal action can or would be taken.

Any code from this repository that becomes a part of your own projects (i.e the `.babelrc`) will fall under whatever license
you use for your project. In this way, the license is basically "deferred" until you choose which one you'd like to use.
